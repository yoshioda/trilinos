/** Interface (abstract base class) for computing a new partitioning and
  describing the layout of elements in the new partitions.

  If the methods which describe the new partitioning (e.g., 
  newPartitionNumber(), etc.) are called before compute_partitioning()
  has been called, behavior is not well defined. Implementations will
  either return empty/erroneous data, or throw an exception. In most
  cases, implementations will probably call compute_partitioning()
  internally in a constructor or factory method, so this won't usually
  be an issue.

  /** Method which does the work of computing a new partitioning.
     Implementations of this interface will typically be constructed
     with an object or information describing the existing ('old')
     partitioning. This method computes a 'new' rebalanced
     partitioning for that input data.

     \param force_repartitioning Optional argument defaults to false.
        Depending on the implementation, compute_partitioning() should
        only perform a repartitioning the first time it is called, and
        subsequent repeated calls are no-ops. If the user's intent is
        to re-compute the partitioning (e.g., if parameters or other
        inputs have been changed), then setting this flag to true
        will force a new partitioning to be computed.
